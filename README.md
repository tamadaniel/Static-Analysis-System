# Static-Analysis-System

  A custom application in Python communicates with Wii Balance Board (WBB) by Bluetooth. The WBB is a rigid plate with four strain gauges that can measure up to 150 kg (330 pounds). By measuring the four strain gauges forces, the Center of Pressure(COP) is calculated using equations 1 and 2 to Medio-Lateral (x) and Antero-Posterior (y) axis respectively.
